# 🧠 DeepKlarity — AI-Powered Wikipedia Quiz Generator

**DeepKlarity** is a full-stack web application that automatically generates quiz questions from Wikipedia articles using Artificial Intelligence (AI).  
It bridges the gap between knowledge and interactivity by transforming static Wikipedia content into dynamic, self-assessing quizzes.  

---

## 🧾 Abstract

In today’s digital era, online information sources like **Wikipedia** serve as massive repositories of knowledge. However, passive reading often leads to low retention.  
DeepKlarity addresses this by introducing an **AI-powered learning companion** that automatically generates **multiple-choice quizzes** from Wikipedia content, enabling users to **test their understanding instantly**.

The project leverages **FastAPI** for backend logic, **React** for an interactive UI, and **Google Gemini (AI Model)** to intelligently generate relevant questions, answers, and explanations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Automate quiz generation from **Wikipedia** URLs using AI.  
- Allow users to **view, store, and retake quizzes** anytime.  
- Provide **explanations** for each answer to enhance learning.  
- Record and display **quiz scores and attempt timestamps**.  
- Offer a clean, user-friendly **web interface** with real-time updates.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Traditional learning platforms rely heavily on static reading material and manual question preparation.  
Learners often lack immediate tools to assess how much they understood from an article.  
Creating quizzes manually is time-consuming and subjective.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

DeepKlarity automates the entire quiz creation process:
1. Users provide a **Wikipedia article URL**.  
2. The system scrapes the page content (summary, key entities, and sections).  
3. An **AI model (Google Gemini)** processes this data to generate questions and answers.  
4. The quiz is saved locally for review and analysis.  
5. Users can view, delete, or reattempt quizzes, and their scores are recorded for future tracking.

## 🧠 AI Quiz Generation Workflow

1. **Scraper Module (`scraper.py`)**

   * Extracts Wikipedia title, summary, and key sections.
   * Cleans and structures text for AI input.

2. **AI Module (`quiz_generator.py`)**

   * Sends extracted content to Gemini model.
   * Generates a structured JSON with:

     * Question
     * Options
     * Correct Answer
     * Difficulty
     * Explanation

3. **Database Layer**

   * Stores all generated quizzes.
   * Records quiz creation and score submission timestamps.

4. **Frontend Rendering**

   * Displays quiz history and details.
   * Uses modals to show full quiz content.
